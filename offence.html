                Possession of any copying material such as notes, chits, books, printed matter, 
                or any unauthorized reference material inside the examination hall is treated 
                as a serious examination offence, irrespective of whether the material is actually 
                used during the examination. Such possession is considered an attempt to adopt 
                unfair means and compromises the integrity and fairness of the examination process.

                  examination attempt. Further disciplinary action may be taken as per

                inside the examination hall, along with actual copying or attempting to
                copy from such material, is considered a serious violation of examination
                rules. Such conduct undermines academic integrity and compromises the
                fairness of the examination process. This offence applies irrespective of
                the quantity of material possessed and includes any attempt to gain unfair
                 advantage during the examination.

                Mutual / Mass copying
            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                Mutual or mass copying refers to a situation where two or more learners are found to 
                be copying from one another or are collectively involved in the exchange of answers or 
                information during the examination. Such behaviour may include sharing answer sheets, 
                communicating answers verbally or through signals, or any coordinated attempt by a group 
                of learners to gain unfair advantage. Mutual or mass copying is considered a grave offence 
                as it directly compromises the integrity, fairness, and credibility of the examination process.

            <p class="mt-4 p-3 bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-700 text-red-900 font-semibold rounded-md">
                All learners involved in mutual or mass copying shall be excluded from the College Examinations

                appropriate by the Examination Committee.

                Impersonation 
            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                Impersonation refers to appearing for an examination on behalf of another learner or allowing another 
                individual to appear in one’s place in any College or other examination. Such acts involve deliberate 
                misrepresentation of identity and constitute a serious breach of examination rules and academic integrity. 
                Impersonation undermines the credibility of the examination system and is regarded as a grave form of 
                examination malpractice.

               The learner shall be excluded from the College Examinations concerned for five subsequent examinations. 
               In cases where the impersonator is also a learner of the College, both learners involved shall be subject 
               to the same punishment, along with any further disciplinary action as decided by the Examination Committee.

                Interfering with, tampering, or counterfeiting the College seal, answer books, or any official office 
                stationery used in the conduct of examinations, with the intention of misleading the examination authorities, 
                is considered a grave and premeditated offence. Such actions include falsification of official documents, 
                misuse of institutional seals, or manipulation of examination materials to gain unfair advantage. This offence 
                directly undermines the credibility, authenticity, and integrity of the examination system and is viewed as a 
                serious breach of institutional trust and discipline.

                Using obscene, abusive, or threatening language, or issuing violent threats inside the examination hall by a learner 
                towards the room supervisor, invigilator, or any other examination authority is considered a serious act of misconduct. 
                Such behaviour disrupts the examination environment, creates fear or intimidation, and undermines the authority of 
                examination personnel. This offence includes verbal abuse, aggressive conduct, or any form of threatening behaviour 
                intended to influence or obstruct the fair conduct of the examination.

                Insertion of currency notes or offering monetary benefits, including any attempt to bribe a person connected with the conduct 
                of the examination such as an invigilator, supervisor, or other examination authority, is considered a serious act of 
                examination misconduct. Such behaviour compromises the fairness and integrity of the examination process and is treated as a 
                grave violation of institutional discipline.
